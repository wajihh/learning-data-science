This is a helper readme file with information what is in this project
Sure! Below are the steps to modify and run your `test.py` file using VS Code and the command line on Windows 11. I will also include the steps to push your changes to GitHub.

### Step 1: Open VS Code

1. Open VS Code on your Windows 11 machine.

### Step 2: Open Your Project Folder

1. In VS Code, open the project folder that contains your `test.py` file. You can do this by clicking on `File` > `Open Folder...` and selecting the appropriate folder.

### Step 3: Open the Terminal in VS Code

1. In VS Code, open the integrated terminal by pressing `Ctrl + ` (backtick) or by clicking on `Terminal` > `New Terminal` from the top menu.

### Step 4: Modify Your `test.py` File

1. In the Explorer pane (usually on the left side), locate and click on `test.py` to open it in the editor.
2. Make the necessary modifications to your `test.py` file.

### Step 5: Run Your `test.py` File

1. In the terminal, ensure you are in the directory where your `test.py` file is located. If not, navigate to it using the `cd` command. For example:
    ```sh
    cd path\to\your\project\folder
    ```
2. Run the `test.py` file using Python. You can use the following command:
    ```sh
    python test.py
    ```
   or if you are using Python 3 specifically:
    ```sh
    python3 test.py
    ```

### Step 6: Add Changes to Git

1. Check the status of your repository to see the changes:
    ```sh
    git status
    ```
2. Add the modified `test.py` file to the staging area:
    ```sh
    git add test.py
    ```

### Step 7: Commit Your Changes

1. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Modified test.py to add new features"
    ```

### Step 8: Push Your Changes to GitHub

1. Push the committed changes to your GitHub repository:
    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```
   Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if your branch is different.

### Summary of Commands
Here's a summary of the commands you might use:

```sh
# Open terminal in VS Code

# Navigate to the project folder (if necessary)
cd path\to\your\project\folder

# Run the Python file
python test.py
# or
python3 test.py

# Check Git status
git status

# Add modified file to staging
git add test.py

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Modified test.py to add new features"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

This should cover the entire process of modifying, running, and pushing changes to your `test.py` file using VS Code and the command line on Windows 11.
